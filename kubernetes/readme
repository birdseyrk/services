I have not figured out how to deploy the service going through ingress.
I did have it working

This does not need the ingress, but the complete setup does.  See serveruistatus kubernetes

/share/dev/1-kubernetes-deployments/serverstatus

kubectl apply -f server-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f server-service-nodeport.yaml

kubectl delete -f server-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f server-service-nodeport.yaml
